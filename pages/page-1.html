         <p> As the dust settles it is worth noting that the person least surprised by this is the PSG forward himself who, despite pushing for a move for months, feared from day one this summer that this was a deal always destined to fail.</p>

            <p>The minimum requirement for the successful outcome of any sales transaction - be it for a yard of elastic or a billionaire footballer with talent to burn - is either a willing buyer or an enthusiastic seller, or preferably both.</p>
            
                <p> On this occasion, however, Barcelona felt the French champions never wanted to sell and PSG always thought the Spanish giants never wanted to buy.</p>
            
                    <p> This was the mutual mistrust that underscored the negotiations from the start. Even by the convoluted, conspiratorial and brain-achingly complex minefield that is football transfer negotiations, this was always going to be a uniquely unwieldy deal to bring to a conclusion.
            
            So, how did we get here?</p>
            
            <p> In April, the 27-year-old Brazilian - who moved to France from Barcelona for a world record £200m in August 2017 - started talks to renew his PSG contract.</p>
            
            <p>Unfortunately, there were a number of small "issues" making him unhappy: promises PSG were not fulfilling, boos from some of the fans, a spat with fellow forward Edinson Cavani as to who should take penalties, internal divisions within the camp, a sense the Ultra fans were keener on Cavani than him; and the feeling he was not being given sufficient protection by referees.</p>
            
            <p> In January, three fouls in quick succession by Strasbourg's Anthony Goncalves - all of which merited a yellow card, none of which received one - left Neymar with the foot injury that kept him out for 18 games. He was not impressed..</p>
         <p>Despite boasting one of the world's strongest squads, some players exist in a gilded cage at PSG, and a lack of competition in a weak French Ligue 1 created a bickering, febrile atmosphere within the camp.</p>
         <p>The captains of Barcelona - Lionel Messi, Gerard Pique, Sergio Busquets, Sergi Roberto and Luis Suarez - had been told by president Josep Maria Bartomeu that not only would the club try to get Neymar, but also that he was confident the player would come back.

            Neymar was told by players he communicates with regularly (Messi, Pique and Suarez) that the deal would happen and that he was needed if Barcelona were to regain the Champions League. It got under the Brazilian's skin, not least because he was never totally convinced by his decision to leave the Nou Camp in the first place.</p>
